## Background

**License plate detection** is a general task for most autonomous driving and computer vision comopanies. To train a license plate detector with high performance, we had to feed as many pictures into the model as possible. However, collecting real license plates will cost much resources and may infridge on strangers' privacy. One solution is to generate license plate with simple python script, just like what we provided in `genPlate.py`(Easy work, just random combinations of Characters and Digits). The problem followed by this solution is that the generated plates are all of high quality. We all know that training model with high quality images may cause your model degrade in the real world scene. Of course that you could add Gaussian noise and make some transformations on these images to lower the resolution of images delibrately. But, we could not guarantee that the generated images will have the same distribution with real world images. When talking about `distribution`, we could not ignore GAN. So here **GAN** comes to the rescue.


## Install

This project uses [pix2pix](https://github.com/junyanz/pytorch-CycleGAN-and-pix2pix) model, I have already integrated them into this repository so you do not need to clone the original model.

```python
python3 import test.py
```

## Pipeline
### Prepare dataset to train GAN model


Please run genplate.py to get perfect license plate, then extract the outlines to feed into the GAN model. The GAN model deployed here is pix2pix.

step 1: run genplate.py to generate perfect license plate images. 

step 2: run extractOutline.py to extact the outlines of these generated images.



## Usage

```sh

```
